    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack Overflow, the go-to platform for developers, conducted a global survey to capture insights into the developer community. This survey includes various questions related to professional experience, coding activities, tools, technologies, and preferences. The dataset offers important information about the current state of software development worldwide and covers topics such as demographics, salary, education, career paths, and technology usage.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the responses from the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey to answer key questions such as:  \n",
    "1. How does average salary vary with years of experience?  \n",
    "2. Which programming languages are most used by region?  \n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between education level and annual salary?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Salary vs. Experience:** Median salary increases by 156% after 5 years of experience.  \n",
    "- **Top Languages:** JavaScript commands 11.6% usage among developers\n",
    "- **Education Level and Annual Salary:** Formal education boosts earning potential by up to 60%.\n",

    "## FINAL CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Work experience** has a strong positive correlation with salary, especially in the first **5â10 years**, where annual compensation increases sharply. Salary growth slows after 15+ years.\n",
    "- **Age** shows a similar pattern: compensation rises steadily with age until around 60, then begins to decline slightly, indicating that career growth tends to level off in the later stages.\"\n",
    "- **Education level** impacts earnings significantly, those with **professional, bachelorâs, or masterâs degrees** earn the highest salaries, while primary/secondary education yields the lowest.\n",
    "- **Remote workers** earn the most on average (**\\$78,700 USD**), followed by hybrid workers, while **in-person workers earn 33% less**, highlighting the market value of work flexibility.\n",
    "- The relationship between **years of coding, compensation, and job satisfaction (normalized)** confirms a trend: more experience leads to higher pay and generally higher satisfaction.\n",
    "- **React** is the most preferred web framework among developers, followed by **Node.js**, **Next.js**, and **Vue.js**, with JavaScript frameworks dominating modern web development.\n",
    "- **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and **Python** are the most used and most wanted programming languages globally, particularly in countries like the **USA**, **India**, and the **UK**.\n",
    "- **USA** has the highest number of developers, followed by **India**, **Germany**, and the **UK**. Representation drops off in regions like Africa, South America, and parts of Asia.\n",
    "- Median **compensation by country** reflects economic differences, **USA** leads, followed by **Canada** and the **UK**, while **India** and **Brazil** have lower medians but many outliers.\n",
    "- **Database usage** by age group shows that **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** are dominant across all groups, especially ages **18â34**. Usage declines with age but remains consistent in younger respondents.\n",
    "- In **top programming languages wanted by country**, trends largely mirror actual usage: developers tend to want to work with the technologies they already use, with **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript** leading interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These findings provide a holistic view of how experience, age, education, work modality, and regional context influence compensation, preferences, and satisfaction in the software development industry.\n"
